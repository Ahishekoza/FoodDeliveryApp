Add To Cart Functionality
We will add the Item selected by the loggedIn user to the cart using user's loggedIn user Id

The purpose of arrayUnion is to update an array field
within a Firestore document by adding selectedFoodItem to the array 
if it doesn't already exist in it.
If the element is already present in the array, it won't create a duplicate; Firestore will ensure that the array contains only unique elements.
